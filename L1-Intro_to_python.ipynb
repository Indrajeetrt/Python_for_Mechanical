    "### Why Python is created\n",
    "Once upon a time, in the late 1980s, there lived a programmer named Guido van Rossum in the Netherlands. Guido had a keen mind and a passion for creating tools that made people's lives easier. He worked on a programming language called ABC, which had some good ideas but fell short in certain areas. Guido, however, saw its potential and carried a dream in his heart—to create a programming language that was simple, powerful, and elegant.\n",
    "\n",
    "One snowy December, while reflecting on the quirks and complexities of programming, an idea struck him. He envisioned a language that could be understood as easily as reading a book, one that beginners could learn and use without fear, but also one that would be robust enough for professionals to tackle big, complex problems. Thus began Guido's quest to create this language.\n",
    "\n",
    "During a quiet holiday break, Guido set to work in his small home office. With a cup of coffee by his side and determination in his heart, he started developing what would later become Python. He named it not after the snake, as many assume, but as a tribute to his favorite comedy troupe, Monty Python, because he wanted the language to be fun as well as practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guido's language grew out of a few guiding principles: clarity, simplicity, and versatility. He wanted its code to feel natural, almost like writing English. He imagined a world where coders wouldn't get tangled up in unnecessary complexity, and their ideas could come to life swiftly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "By 1991, Guido's vision was ready to share with the world. He released Python as an open-source language, inviting others to use, improve, and grow it. To his amazement, people around the globe embraced it with enthusiasm, and Python began to thrive. From data scientists to web developers, students to AI researchers, Python became a universal language of innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Python stands as a testament to Guido's dream—a language that bridges the gap between simplicity and power, creativity and practicality. Its story is not just one of code, but of human ingenuity and the desire to make knowledge and tools accessible to all."
